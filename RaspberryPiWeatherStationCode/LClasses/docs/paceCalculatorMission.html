If you downloaded this application and are using it, it probably
means you are a runner.  Since you are a runner that probably means
you are concerned with your health.  Continuing with the stereotype,
it also probably means you are concerned with other social and/or
environmental issues.  One <b>close call</b> with a careless
motorist, and your outlook on life can change forever.
<p>
This software is <b>free</b>.  Hopefully, this  software has been
