\textbf{Use Case S6:  Detailed Description}\\\\
Use Case Name:  Save Meteorological Data\\
Scenrio:  Save Temperature Data\\
Brief Description:  With the System running, the System saves the
daily temperature data--including the Extreme data (minium and
maximum).\\
Actors:  System.\\
Related Use Cases:\\
\textbf{Use Case S1:  }\emph{The System Shall Monitor Temperature
Data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders:  }Local and National Weather Bureaus and
individuals monitoring local weather data.\\
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The System is running, the temperature data
is saved periodically in System Memory.\\
\textbf{Postconditions:  }The Data is saved off in the appropriate
format (.csv, .txt):  all three units are saved off (Celsius,
Fahrenheit, Kelvin).\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events}\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{System} & \textbf{One Wire Temperature Sensor}\\\hline
&1.  Return requested temperature\\
&    data (See \emph{Use Case S1--}\\
&    \emph{Request Temperature Data})\\\hline
2.  Stores the data in memory & \\\hline
3.  Grabs the Month and Day  of the stored &\\
    data and compares to the Month and Day &\\
    of the current date. &\\\hline
4.  From \#3, if the Compared Month and Day &\\
    are diffent, save off all the temperature &\\
    data and the date recorded. & \\\hline
5.  From \#3, save off the Temperature Extremes &\\
    including the Date and Time of the Extreme &\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Exception Conditions}\\
4a.  If the One Wire Temperature Sensor stops working and
the System Records the default temperature, then the System does not
save the entry for that record.\\\\
5a.  If the Extreme Temperature is recorded as the default Etreme
temperatures (-999.9 for maximum, 999.9 for minimum), the the System
does not save the extreme data for that date, indicating no extreme
temperature data was recorded for that date.\\
\textbf{Note:  }This would be an indication the Temperature sensor
stopped working completely for that date.
