\textbf{Use Case W2:  Detailed Description}
\end{center}
\vspace{4ex}
Use Case Name:  Request Humidity Data\\
Scenario:  N/A\\
Brief Description:  With the System collecting weather data, the
weather network requests humidity data by periodically requesting
requesting the humidity data from the weather stations (system).\\
Actors:  Weather Network\\\\
Related Use Cases:\\
\textbf{Use Case A1:  }\textit{The Administrator shall set the
Measurement Rate for all all active sensors}\\
\textbf{Use Case W11:  }\textit{The Weather Network Shall request
daily humidity extreems}\\
\textbf{Use Case W16:  }\textit{The Weather Network Shall log
requested weather data}\\\\
\textbf{Stakeholders:  }Local and National Weather Bureaus, other
weather networks and individuals monitoring loacal weather data.\\\\
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The System is running, the measurement rate
is set, the network is set and working, the humidity measuring
hardware is connected to the weather station.\\\\
\textbf{Postconditions:  }The Humidity data is recieved from the
weather station(s) (system).\\\\

\textbf{Weather Station} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Periodically request humidity & \\

3.  Logs data returned by the system & \\
(See \textbf{Use Case W16}) & \\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Exception Conditions}\\
2a.  If the Humidity Sensors are not working properly, then the
system shall report a default humidity (-99.9\%).\\
2b.  If the the System Network stops working properly, then the
system shall report a default humidity (-99.9\%).
