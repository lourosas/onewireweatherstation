\textbf{Use Case I3S2:  Detailed Description}
\end{center}
Use Case Name:  Manage Mission Data\\
Scenario: S2 View Humidity Data;\\
Brief Description:  With the System Running, the User requests to view
the current Humidity Data (regardless if a Mission is Running).\\
Actors:  User\\
Related Use Cases:  N/A\\\\
Stakeholders:  Users who want to view the current Humidity Data from
the current mission.\\\\
Preconditions:  The System is running, the iButton is connected to the
receptor or another reading device.  The iButton receptor or other
reading device is connected to the computer.\\\\
Postconditions:  The Humidity data is retrieved from the iButton and
presented to the User for display.  (In either textual or graphical
form).\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events}\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request Humidity Data for &\\
viewing & \\\hline
& 2.  Retrieves the current Humidity\\
& data\\\hline
& 3.  Retrieves the associated Date/Time \\
& for all the current Humidity Data\\\hline
& 4.  Separates the Humidity Data by\\
& Date.\\\hline
& 5.  Determines the Min/Max of the\\
& current  Humidity data and the\\
&  asscociated  Date/Time.\\\hline
& 6.  Presents the requested Humidity\\
& data to the User for viewing.\\\hline
8.  Determines how to view the data &\\
(in \textbf{Text or Graphical} format) &\\
Makes that request to the System & \\\hline
& 9.  Presents the data in the requested\\
& format.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Exception Conditions}\\
1a.  If no iButton Device is connected to the network, then the system
indicates the error to the user with the reason (no iButton Attached).
\\\\
2a.  If the requested data of the current mission cannot be retrieved,
then the system indicates the error to the user with the reason
(\textit{One Wire Network Issues, One Wire Device Issues}).\\\\
3a.  If the associated Date/Time of the requested data of the current
mission cannot be retrieved, then the system indicates the error to
the user with the reason (\textit{One Wire Network Issues, One Wire
Device Issues, other forms of retrieval exceptions}.)
