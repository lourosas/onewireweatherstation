\textbf{Use Case I3S1:  Detailed Description}
\end{center}
Use Case Name: Manage Mission Data\\
Scenario S1:  View Temperature Data\\
Brief Description:  With the System Running, the User requests to view
the current Temperature Data (regardless if a Mission is Running).\\
Actors:  User\\
Related Use Cases:  N/A\\\\
Stakeholders:  Users who want to view the current Temperature Data from
the current mission.\\\\
Preconditions:  The System is running, the iButton is connected to the
receptor or another reading device.  The iButton receptor or other
reading device is connected to the computer.\\\\
Postconditions:  The Temperature Data is retrieved from the iButton and
presented to the User for display.  (Either in textual or graphical
form).\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events}\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request Temperature Data for &\\
viewing & \\\hline
& 2.  Retrieves the current temperature\\
& data\\\hline
& 3.  Converts the temperature data\\
& into the three different units: \\
& \textbf{Metric, English, Absolute}.\\\hline
& 4.  Retrieves the associated Date/Time\\
& for all the current temperature data\\\hline
& 5.  Separates the temperature data by\\
& date.\\\hline
& 6.  Determines the Min/Max of the current\\
& data, converting into the three different\\
& units:  for every/all data separated by date.\\\hline
& 7.  Presents the requested temperature\\
& data to the User for viewing.\\\hline
8. Determines how to view the data & \\
(in \textbf{Text or Graphical} format) & \\
Makes request to the System &\\\hline
& 9.  Presents the data in the requested\\
& format\\\hline
10.  Determines the Units & \\
\textbf{Metric, Englilsh, Absolute} and & \\
makes request to the System &\\\hline
& 11.  Presents the data in the appropriate\\
& Units\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Exception Conditions}\\
1a.  If no iButton Device is connected to the network, the the system
indicates the error to the user with the reason (no iButton Atached).\\\\
2a.  If the requested data of the current mission cannot be retrieved,
then the system indicates the error to the user with the reason (One
Wire Netwok Issues, One Wire Device Issues).
