Use Case Name:  Alter Data Collection Rate\\
Scenario:  N/A\\
Brief Description:  With the System Running, the User set the data
collection rate prior to starting a mission.  The System sets the
data collection rate, and starts the requested mission (See

Actors:  User\\
Related Use Cases: Use Case I2S2 \textit{Start A Mission}\\
Use Case I2S1 \textit{Stop A Mission}\\\\
Stakeholders:  Users who want to change the data collection rate on
the iButton (from the default setting).\\\\
Preconditions:  The System is running, the iButton is connected to
the receptor or another reading device.  The iButton receptor or
other reading device is connected to the computer.\\\\
Postconditions:  The Collection rate on the iButton is altered.\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events}\\\\
