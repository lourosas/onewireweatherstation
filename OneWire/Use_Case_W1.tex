\textbf{Use Case W1:  Detailed Description}
\end{center}
\vspace{4ex}
Use Case Name:  Request Temperature Data\\
Scenario:  N/A\\
Brief Description:  With the System Collecting weather data, the
weather network requests temperature data by periodically requesting
temperature data from the weather stations (system).\\
Actors:  Weather Network\\
Related Use Cases:\\
\textbf{Use Case A1:  }\textit{The Administrator shall set the
Measurement Rate foall all active sensors}\\
\textbf{Use Case W10:  }\textit{The Weather Network Shall request
daily temperature extreems}\\
\textbf{Use Case W15:  }\textit{The Weather Network Shall set
measurment units for weather data}\\
\textbf{Use Case W16:  }\textit{The Weather Network Shall log
requested weather data}\\\\
\textbf{Stakeholders:  }Local and National Weather Bureaus, other
weather networks and individuals monitoring loacal weather data.\\\\
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The System is running, the measurement rate
is set, the network is set and working, the thermometer hardware is
connected to the weather station.\\\\
\textbf{Postconditions:  }The Temperature data is recieved from the
weather station(s) (system).\\\\
\textbf{Flow of Events}\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{Weather Station} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Periodically request temperature & \\
data from the System & 2.  Returns the temperature\\
                     & data requested in the \\
                     & appropriate units\\\hline
3.  Logs data returned by the system & \\
(See \textbf{Use Case W16}) & \\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Exception Conditions}\\
2a.  If the Temperature Sensors are not working properly, then the
system shall report a default temperature (-999.9$^\circ$).\\
2b.  If the the System Network stops working properly, then the
system shall report a default temperature (-999.9$^\circ$).
